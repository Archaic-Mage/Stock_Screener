# STOCK SCREENER (WIP)

## Description

This repository contains utililty functions to fetch nse stock data (live (one min) and pre-market) and perform basic analysis to screen stocks based on various parameters.

This will provide a list of stocks that are good for intraday trading.

This also contains a live stock screener which will alert you the stocks based on the parameters you set.

## Usage

Just run the following command to start the screener:

```bash
python3 get_mdata.py
```

## Futher Work

- Add more parameters to screen stocks.
- Provide ways to set you own screening function (currently it is hardcoded) and alert you based on that.
- May include a GUI for the interaction.
